# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
Using neural networks to help the charity foundation predict where to make investments
## Analysis Overview

## Results

### Data Preprocessing
1. What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
2. What variable(s) are considered to be the features for you model?
3. variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
1. How many neurons, layers, and activation funcations did you select for your neural network model, and why?
2. Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
3. What steps did yo utake to try and increase nodel performance?
